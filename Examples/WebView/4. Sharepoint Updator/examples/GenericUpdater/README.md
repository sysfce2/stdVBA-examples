# Generic SharePoint updater

Range-driven Create/Update tool for arbitrary SharePoint lists. Point an Excel table at a site + list title, fill rows, and batch-write in chunks of 500.

## Files

- `src/GenericUpdater.bas` — core API
- `src/mMain.bas` — demo macros (`mainRunGenericUpdater`, `mainFetchFields`)
- `Generic Sharepoint Updator.xlsm` — workbook with `DataToUpdate` ListObject, `SITE_URL`, `LIST_NAME`

## Quick start

1. Set named ranges `SITE_URL` and `LIST_NAME` on `shInput`.
2. Run `mainFetchFields` to ensure `Type`, `ID`, and writable field columns exist on `DataToUpdate`.
3. Fill rows (`Type` = `Create` or `Update`).
4. Run `mainRunGenericUpdater`. Results dump to `shOutput!A1`.

```vb
Dim results As Variant: results = GenericUpdater.UpdateList(SiteURL, ListTitle, PatchData)
Call GenericUpdater.DumpResults(results, Dest)

Dim added As Long: added = GenericUpdater.EnsureTableFields(SiteURL, ListTitle, Table)
```

## Reserved columns

| Column | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Type` | `Create` or `Update` (case-insensitive). If the column is missing, every row is treated as `Update`. |
| `ID` | Required for `Update` (positive SharePoint item id). Ignored for `Create`. On successful Create, the new SharePoint Id is written into the results `ID` column. |

All other headers must match a writable list field by **Title** or **InternalName** (case-insensitive). Unknown headers fail **every** row and skip all writes.

## Cell encoding (all field columns)

| Cell value | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Empty / blank | **Skip** — omit from the payload. Update leaves the existing SharePoint value. Create omits the field. |
| `null` (trim, case-insensitive) | **Clear** — send JSON `null` (person/lookup clear `FieldId`; multi-person/multi-choice send empty results). |
| Any other value | Validate and include in the write. |

Safety notes:

- Blank is intentionally non-destructive so unfinished cells do not wipe SharePoint data.
- Required fields cannot be cleared with `null`.
- On **Create**, required fields cannot be blank (they would be omitted).

## Row `Type` behaviour

### Update

- Requires a numeric positive `ID`.
- Duplicate IDs in the same run: first row may update; later duplicates fail validation.
- Only non-blank, non-`null` cells are PATCHed; blank cells leave existing values alone.

### Create

- `ID` is ignored (leave blank).
- Uses `BatchItemsCreate`.
- On Success, results `ID` is filled with the new item id.
- Required SharePoint fields must be provided (not blank, not `null`).

## Field type special cases

Values below assume the column was mapped from list schema (e.g. via `EnsureTableFields` / `FieldsFetchSchema`) so `stdSharepointList` transforms apply.

### Text / Note

- Sent as a string.
- If SharePoint reports `MaxLength`, values longer than that fail validation.

### Number / Currency / Integer

- Must be numeric in Excel.
- Sent as a number.

### Boolean

Accepted cell text (case-insensitive): `TRUE` / `FALSE`, `1` / `0`, `Yes` / `No`.

### DateTime

- Excel dates or parseable date strings.
- Transformed to SharePoint datetime format by `stdSharepointList`.

### Choice

- Must exactly match one of the list’s choice values (when choices are returned by schema).
- Match is case-insensitive for dictionary lookup.

### MultiChoice

- Split on `;` or `,`.
- Each non-empty part must be a valid choice (when choices are known).
- Example: `Red;Blue` or `Red,Blue`.

### Person

Accepted cell values:

| Input | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| Email, e.g. `alex@contoso.com` | Resolved via SharePoint `ensureuser` to a site user id, then written as `FieldNameId`. |
| Numeric SharePoint user id | Used directly as `FieldNameId`. |

Not accepted by GenericUpdater validation:

- Display name only (no `@`)
- Arbitrary login strings without `@` (unless numeric)

The email must be resolvable in that tenant/site. Unknown emails fail at resolve/`ensureuser` time (row or batch error).

Create and Update use the same person resolution path.

### MultiPerson

- Same rules as Person per entry.
- Split on `;` or `,`.
- Example: `alex@contoso.com;sam@contoso.com` or `12;34`.

### Lookup

- Must be a numeric lookup item id (not the lookup display text).
- Written as `FieldNameId`.

### File / read-only / calculated / counter / Id

- Not treated as writable by schema filtering.
- `EnsureTableFields` also skips **Hidden** fields.
- Do not add these as patch columns.

### Clearing complex fields with `null`

| Field type | Wire effect |
| --- | --- |
| Person / Lookup | `FieldNameId: null` |
| MultiPerson | `FieldNameId: { results: [] }` |
| MultiChoice | empty `Collection(Edm.String)` results |
| Date / text / other | JSON `null` |

## Call flow (`UpdateList`)

1. `stdSharepointAuthenticator.Create(SiteURL)`
2. `auth.protEnsureAuthenticated`
3. `stdSharepointList.CreateFromTitle(SiteURL, ListTitle, auth)`
4. `list.FieldsFetchSchema`
5. Verify field names — mismatch → fail all rows, no write
6. Validate each row; invalid rows are logged and skipped
7. `BatchItemsCreate` / `BatchItemsSet` in 500-item chunks for valid rows

## Results

`UpdateList` returns a 1-based array (dump with `DumpResults`):

| ID | SuccessFailure | FailureReason |
| --- | --- | --- |

- Input row order is preserved.
- Create Success rows get the new SharePoint Id in `ID`.
- Per-item HTTP failures include SharePoint `error.message.value` when present.
- A whole batch HTTP failure marks that chunk’s rows as Failure and continues with later chunks.

## `EnsureTableFields` / `mainFetchFields`

- Ensures `Type` and `ID` exist (inserts at the front if missing).
- Appends any missing non-hidden writable fields.
- New headers use **Title**, falling back to **InternalName**.
- Existing columns and data are kept.
- Returns the number of columns added.

## Tips

- Prefer `mainFetchFields` before filling data so person/date/choice columns get the correct field-type transforms.
- For people, use work email or site user id — not display name.
- For lookups, use the related item’s numeric Id.
- Leave cells blank to skip; type `null` only when you intentionally want to clear.
